# ðŸ–Š Digital signing of documents

As you know from our statement, we are dedicated to making our carbon footprint as small as possible. We realised that a big part of our carbon footprint is the documents that we make and the ones that we need to get a signatures for.

Thanks to [eIDAS](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation), we can use digital signatures to sign documents. Just as legal, but less less impact on our digital footprint. We could've opted for [DocuSign](https://docusign.com), but we decided to use [DocuSeal](https://docuseal.eu) because of it's flexibility and open nature.

Moving forward, we will only use digital documents, reserving paper for only mandatory documents that need to be in physical form.

### How does this work?

We know that this is a new method of signing documents and we can agree that it can be confusing for some people. But it's not really that complicated.

Here are the steps that a document goes through to being signed:

1. An email gets sent to a specific address that needs to be the signee. A link will be present that allows them to sign the document. **Always make sure it comes from a Roseto email address (ex. mario@roseto.space)**;
2. The Signee clicks the link and gets forwarded to [DocuSeal](https://docuseal.eu);
3. The Signee completes the needed fields and then proceeds to sign the document by drawing;
4. After every required field gets filled, the signee confirms the signing of the document and the signed document gets sent back to us. The signee can also download or send themselves a copy of the document;
5. And that's it! Everything is straight forward and simple so everyone can understand;

### We love it!

We strongly advise other organisations and businesses and individuals to check out [DocuSign](https://docusign.com) or other digital signing services. This way we can help cutting down on unnecessary paper.
