# ðŸŒ³ Our commitment to sustainability

We are very commited to keeping our carbon footprint as small as possible.

Yes, websites do have a carbon footprint, and the internet being so big, it can actually have a real impact on the world around us.

{% hint style="info" %}
According to [Website Carbon Calculator](https://websitecarbon.com):

> The internet consumes a lot of electricity. 416.2TWh per year to be precise. To give you some perspective, that's more than the entire United Kingdom.

### Optimizing Data Usage: Less is More

Central to our sustainability strategy is our unwavering focus on optimizing data usage. Through meticulous data management, we ensure that every bit of information transmitted serves a purpose. By employing various techniques, we reduce the volume of data required for various processes, thus lowering energy consumption and lessening the strain on digital infrastructure. This not only enhances the efficiency of our operations but also minimizes the energy required for data transmission.

### Thoughtful Request Management: Quality over Quantity

We firmly believe in the principle of quality over quantity, even in the digital realm. By employing intelligent algorithms and thoughtful request management, we aim to curtail excessive data requests. This approach not only conserves energy but also streamlines the user experience. Our commitment to reducing unnecessary requests serves as a testament to our dedication to both efficiency and sustainability.

Sustainability is one of our key principles that we have been following since day 1.
