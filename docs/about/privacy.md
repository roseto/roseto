# üîê Privacy

Privacy is another one of our top priorities. While some of our projects might use [Umami](https://umami.is), an open source analytics tool, we collect minimal data, and only when necessary.

The data we collect is not being shared with any third-party and we keep only anonymous data. That's how we solve the cookie prompt problem, we don't show any cookie prompt. Plus you can always disable this collection of data, no questions asked.

When not necessary, we don't collect any data.

## Participant privacy

Some of our projects require participants, such as training activities, sessions and more. We are dedicated to respecting our participants' privacy. This also applies to our partners. All of our partnerships have a specific section specifing very strict access to participant data, only allowing required data.
