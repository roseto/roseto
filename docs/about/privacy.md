# üîê Privacy

We don't collect any personal data. We only track visits on our website via Cloudflare. Visits are not linked to you as a person in any shape or form.

## Participant privacy

Some of our projects require participants, such as training activities, sessions and more. We are dedicated to respecting our participants' privacy. This also applies to our partners. All of our partnerships have a specific section specifing very strict access to participant data, only allowing required data.
