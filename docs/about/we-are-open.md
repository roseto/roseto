# üëê We are open

We are commited to being as open as possible. Roseto is not a business. Roseto is more than a platform, it's an idea, a community.

And we are dedicated to being as close as possible to our community. That's why we decided to be open source. That's why we opted to be a collective. That's why we are open as possible.

Our development ideas and roadmaps are completely public. The way that we [manage our funds](https://opencollective.com/roseto) is public. The [source code on everything](https://github.com/roseto) we do is public.

We consider that this is the best way to have a community where we can all grow together.
