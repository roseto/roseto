# ciorogarla.eu.org

{% hint style="info" %}
Specification Status - **WIP**
{% endhint %}

## Description

This specification proposes the overhaul of [ciorogarla.eu.org](https://ciorogarla.eu.org), which was previously Platforma Ciorogarla. The domain will be overhauled to host general information about Ciorogarla while giving links to relevant information.

The website [ciorogarla.eu.org](https://ciorogarla.eu.org) will also continue to offer subdomains and emails with this domain.

The objective of this website would be that eventually with enough funding it will turn into a platform for Ciorogarla, using [Bettermode](https://bettermode.com) to host job listings, messages, events, votes, proposals, suggestions, updates.
