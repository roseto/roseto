# Projects

Roseto is a bunch of cool people who love to use technology to make a difference in our communities. We're passionate about empowering the youth and fostering digital transformation, and we believe that tech can be a powerful tool for creating a brighter future for everyone.

## **Our Approach**

We're all about creating experiences that make a real impact. Our projects range from building community platforms to developing mobile apps, and we always strive to find solutions that are both innovative and useful. We're also big believers in sharing our knowledge and skills, so we run workshops, organize events, and mentor young people who are interested in technology.

## **Our Impact**

Our projects have helped a lot of people in Romania:

* **Boosted Digital Literacy:** We've helped young people become more tech-savvy and navigate the digital world with confidence.
* **Nurtured Entrepreneurship:** We've encouraged young people to start their own businesses and become innovators.
* **Strengthened Communities:** We've brought people together through engaging events and initiatives, fostering a sense of belonging.
* **Solved Local Problems:** We've made life easier for people by providing useful tools like bus schedule information and community platforms.

## Project ID

Every project is given a specific ID. This ID comes in this format: `ROSETO-YYYYMMDD`. Where "YYYYMMDD" means the year, month and date that this project has been started to be worked on.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that not all previous projects adhere to this ID system as it was implemented later. We are currently in the process of incorporating this identifier structure across all projects to ensure consistency and accuracy in project management. This effort will help us streamline project oversight

## Budget

Each project receives a designated budget, within which expenses may be incurred. The budget allocation is determined based on the project's scope, objectives, and estimated resource requirements. This allocation ensures that projects have the necessary funding to achieve their goals and deliver tangible results.

The budget is drawn from our [Open Collective resources](https://opencollective.com/roseto), a platform that facilitates secure and transparent financial management. OpenCollective enables us to track project expenditures, maintain financial records, and ensure adherence to budget guidelines. This comprehensive approach to financial management enhances project accountability and promotes responsible resource utilization.
