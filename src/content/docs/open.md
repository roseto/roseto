title: We are open
description: How we are trying to be open in every way possible
---

We are commited to being as open as possible. Roseto is not a 
business. Roseto is more than a platform, it's an idea, a community.

And we are dedicated to being as close as possible to our community.
That's why we decided to be open source. That's why we opted to be a collective.
That's why we are open as possible. 

Our development ideas and roadmaps are completely
public. The way that we [manage our funds](https://opencollective.com/roseto) is public.
The [source code on everything](https://github.com/roseto) we do is public.

We consider that this is the best way to have a community where we can all grow together.
