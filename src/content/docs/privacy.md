Privacy is another one of our top priorities. While some of our projects
might use [Umami](https://umami.is), an open source analytics tool, we collect
minimal data, and only when necessary.

The data we collect is not being shared with any third-party and we keep only anonymous
data. That's how we solve the cookie prompt problem, we don't show any cookie prompt.
Plus you can always disable this collection of data, no questions asked.

When not necessary, we don't collect any data. Like this website. This website is
free of any data collection.
