Ever since we got the [ciorogarla.eu.org](https://ciorogarla.eu.org) domain, we knew
we wanted to do something big with it. That's how we launched "Platforma Ciorogarla",
a web platform created specially for the community of [Ciorogarla, Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciorog%C3%A2rla).


## What do I get?

Since we are able to now charge for services, we decided to offer a website and email address
aliases for only 10EUR/month. For this price you get:

- A premium subdomain under ciorogarla.eu.org (eg. [mazga.ciorogarla.eu.org](https://mazga.ciorogarla.eu.org))
- A premium email address under ciorogarla.eu.org (eg. [marstef@ciorogarla.eu.org](mailto:marstef@ciorogarla.eu.org))
- If you have a business, you can opt to add your business to Platforma Ciorogarla and have a pre-made website
- You also get to help Roseto create great learning experiences for youth

## How to subscribe

So what are you waiting for? If you want better discoverability in Ciorogarla, a ciorogarla.eu.org domain is a must.
