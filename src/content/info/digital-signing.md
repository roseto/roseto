title: Digital signing of documents
description: How we reduced our carbon footprint even more
---

As you know from [our statement](/info/sustainability), we are dedicated to making
our carbon footprint as small as possible. We realised that a big part of our carbon footprint is the documents that we make
and the ones that we need to get a signatures for.

That's why we opted for digital signing for documents. Just as legal, but less
less impact on our digital footprint. We could've opted for [DocuSign](https://docusign.com),
but we decided to use [DocuSeal](https://docuseal.eu) because of it's flexibility and open nature.

Moving forward, we will only use digital documents, reserving paper for only mandatory documents that
need to be in physical form.

We strongly advise other organisations and businesses to check out [DocuSign](https://docusign.com) 
or other digital signing services. This way we can help cutting down on unnecessary paper.
