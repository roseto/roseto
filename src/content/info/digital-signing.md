title: Digital signing of documents
description: How we reduced our carbon footprint even more
---

As you know from [our statement](/info/sustainability), we are dedicated to making
our carbon footprint as small as possible.

We realised that a big part of our carbon footprint is the documents that we make
and the ones that we need to get a signatures for.

That's why we opted for digital signing for documents. Just as legal, but less
less impact on our digital footprint. We created a special service for us to
create digital documents with signatures.

We could've opted for [DocuSign](https://docusign.com), but we decided to create our
own, open-source and branded solution.

We strongly advise other organisations and businesses to check out [DocuSign](https://docusign.com) 
or for an open-source alternative, check out [Documenso](https://documenso.com).
