For most of my life, I haven't really gave any thought to the idea of journals.
Just because I thought that I already know and remember almost anything I am doing.

At some point I realised along my programming adventure that I need some kind of note
taking app. And so I tried tens of note taking apps. Pen and paper, Notion, Neovim, VSCode,
you name it, I tried it. I even got around to creating my own [Minimal Editor](https://marker.angelmario.eu).
I used it for half a year in college for note taking. It was good enough for almost anything I needed so I never
thought I would need anything more. Until I did.

At some point I needed some kind of way to connect my files, query and categorise them in some way.
I never wanted to stray away from the idea of owning every file locally and sync them to my cloud too.
It's not that I didn't like my tool, but I needed something bigger then I could build alone.

I needed some kind of way to interconnect my notes. Link them in some way. Something like a **second brain**.

## Obsidian for your second brain

I am a "stable" person. Once I have found a solution for something I really rely on, I want it 
to last. My note taking app will always be [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 
Maybe the 2 guys working on it won't stick around, but my files, or rather my thoughts, will.
That's the way it really should be. That's how open-source apps work really. Obsidian is not one of them.
Which is really one of the biggest problems you should have with this project. But as long as it doesn't
do any funny stuff to my files or my privacy, I am alright with it.

I consider using Obsidian for your second brain because it's easier and nicer. Of course you could 
use whatever other text editor or note taking app you want, but it's how you use it which makes it
trully powerful.

## Why a second brain

There will come a time when you will hit a point where you will feel as if your brain is not enough for you.
Our little monkey brains can really do so much. And it's limited in storing memories, really. It uses different
methods to store them efficiently. But one thing our brain is really good at is processing. 

So why not move the memory part to another brain? This way you always have access to your 
thoughts and stuff just the way you wrote them. And you don't even need to remember you wrote them. 
Who else could've?

## So give it a go

Make more room for processing power and offload your notes off your brain to your second brain. Unlock
the limits that you feel like you've been hitting for a long time.
