In the heart of Bucharest, under the open skies of Drumul Taberei Park, Roseto,
an informal group dedicated to youth empowerment, recently conducted an impactful
training course on volunteering. In this picturesque setting, our team came together
to inspire and educate young individuals about the power of volunteering, ERASMUS+,
and European Solidarity Corps (ESC) projects, and the essential role they play in
personal and community development.
