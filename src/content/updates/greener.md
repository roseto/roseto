Newest update to Roseto's webpage and [Roseto Link](https://roseto.link) includes
new ways of fetching and displaying data. This will make the website faster and
more reliable.

We managed this by using more caching when building our website, reducing
the build time to an average of 30 seconds. This is a 50% improvement from the
previous build time.

We also use a new way of caching data from the database, only fetching new data
when necessary, such as when a new diploma is issued. This will make [/verify](/verify)
faster and more reliable, while also reducing the load on our servers.

All in all, we made strides to using less resources and less compute time, making 
our servers produce less CO2. We are proud to be a part of the solution to climate change.
