title: Ok, ok, now we really are new!

Following the previous update, we had this coming for a while. We renamed ourselves to "**Roseto Collective**",
which is a name that better represents us. We are a collective of people, and we are working on a project
called Roseto. We are not a company, we are not a startup, we are not a non-profit, we are a collective.

We also changed our domain to [**roseto.co**](https://roseto.co) [roseto.co(llective), get it?], which is shorter and easier to remember. [**roseto.space**](https://roseto.space) 
will still work until 15 Aug 2024, but it will redirect to [**roseto.co**](https://roseto.co).
