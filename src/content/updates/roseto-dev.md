The new and final iteration of Roseto is here. Roseto Collective is now just Roseto.

## But why?

We have been working on Roseto for a while now, and we have been through a lot of changes. We started as
Ciorogarla Unita, then we became Roseto Collective, and now we are just Roseto, while also solidifying
our objective, now focusing on personal development.

We thought this was the best approach for us to take in order to offer more experiences and have a stable foundation for our projects.

Having an unstable base as a an objective was not the best approach for us.
We want to offer more products and services, and we want to be able to do that in a sustainable way.

## What's changing?

Roseto will start offering different products and tiers. We will also start offering services
like web development, web design, and consulting.

Here are some of the changes summarized:
* Roseto Link will be discontinued on Dec 19, 2024;
* Platforma Ciorogarla will be discontinued and replaced with a new service to host web applications;
* `roseto.space` will be closed on Aug 15, 2024;
* `roseto.co` will be closed on Jan 26, 2025;
* Roseto Diplomas will be discontinued on Jan 26th 2024;
* Roseto's internal studio will be closed;
* DocuSeal will not be used anymore;
* `profiteri.eu.org` will be completely removed;
* Roseto Docs will be closed;
* Roseto will reside at `roseto.dev`;

Roseto will still keep it's focus on privacy and security. We will still not track you, we will still not
sell your data, and we will still not have ads. Projects like `ciorogarla.eu.org` will still be available
and community oriented, and we will still be working on open-source projects.

This is the final iteration of Roseto. We are excited to see
what the future holds for us, and we are excited to see what we can build together.
