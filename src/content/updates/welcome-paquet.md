We are happy to announce that [Paquet](https://paquet.app) is now part of Roseto! Paquet is a project that aims to
make web apps more accessible to everyone by providing a simple way of publishing and
discovering web apps. We will fund Paquet and help it grow, and we are excited to see
what the future holds for it.

Paquet is a project that was started by [**Savin Angel-Mario**](https://angelmario.eu), that
quickly gained some traction. We are happy to have this project under our wing, and we
hope to see it grow and become a staple in the web app community.

Paquet will continue to be developed by Mario, with the help of the Roseto Collective. The app
will remain free to use, and we will not introduce any ads or tracking. We will also
continue to respect your privacy and data, and we will not sell your data to third parties.
