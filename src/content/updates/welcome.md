We are happy to announce that we revamped our website. We really hope you like it!

We incorporated a new design language, evolving off of the previous one, but now
everything is bigger and more readable. As you can see, we also added a blog
in the form of a changelog, where we will post updates about the project.

And just because we wanted to celebrate, we also started working on 2 new projects:

- [**Roseto Sync**](https://docs.roseto.co/project-specs/roseto-20240113)
- [**Learning about Volunteering**](https://docs.roseto.co/project-specs/roseto-20240110)
